## Overview

This repository contains the UBC Master of Data Science (MDS), DSCI 525 Group 16 project. The aim of this project is to practice working with big datasets to create and deploy ensemble machine learning models in the cloud as part of the course requirement for the MDS program. 

The dataset used here comes from [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681) and is approximately 6 GB. It contains daily rainfall predictions from various climate models for the NSW State in Australia. The ultimate goal of this project is to build an ensemble ML model to predict daily rainfall in the NSW State region and compare with actual rainfall data.
